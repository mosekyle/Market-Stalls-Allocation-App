        <h3> Stall Management</h3>
        <p>Stall management is a critical component of the market stalls allocation app, encompassing features that allow administrators to add, update, and delete stall records efficiently. Each stall's details, such as its location within the market, size dimensions, and available amenities (e.g., electricity, water supply), are meticulously maintained in the system. This functionality ensures that the market layout is up-to-date, facilitating easy assignment and booking of stalls. The ability to view detailed stall information allows both administrators and vendors to make informed decisions about stall suitability and availability, promoting smooth and effective market operations.</p>

    <h3>Vendor Management</h3>
    <p>Vendor management in the app streamlines the process of registering and managing vendors who wish to operate in the market. Vendors can be added to the system, where their profiles are maintained with essential information such as business name, contact details, and the types of goods or services they offer. Administrators can efficiently assign specific stalls to vendors, ensuring that space allocation is organized and that each vendor’s requirements are met. This component also enables tracking of vendor activities and stall usage, providing a clear overview of vendor operations and facilitating smooth interactions between market administrators and vendors.</p>

    <h3>Payments</h3>
    <p>Handling payments is a pivotal aspect of the app, facilitating the financial transactions related to stall bookings. The system supports various payment methods, enabling vendors to pay for their stall reservations securely and conveniently. It processes these payments, verifies successful transactions, and generates receipts automatically. This capability not only simplifies the payment process for vendors but also helps administrators maintain accurate financial records. Automated receipt generation ensures that vendors have immediate access to proof of payment, and the system’s secure handling of transactions protects sensitive financial data, contributing to the app's reliability and user trust.</p>
