# Market-Stalls-Allocation-App
The system is a software application designed to manage and automate the allocation of market stalls to vendors, considering various factors such as location, stall size, and availability.

> Assigning market stalls to vendors is a complicated task that often causes problems like conflicts and dissatisfaction. The current method of doing it manually isn't very clear, which means stalls might not be distributed fairly among vendors. Also, vendors usually have specific preferences for where they want their stalls and how big they should be. This highlights the importance of taking these preferences into account when assigning stalls. So, there's a clear need for a smart and automated system that not only makes the process smoother but also makes sure vendors are happy by considering what they want and need.

## Specific Objectives
* a.	To create a user-friendly vendor registration process. 
* b.	To design algorithms for efficient stall allocation based on predefined criteria. 
* c.	 To develop a communication module for notifying vendors about allocation results.

The market stalls allocation system has a range of helpful features that make the process of giving stalls to vendors smoother and make vendors happier:
Vendor Registration: Vendors can easily sign up in the system by sharing their information, stall choices, and other important details. This makes it simple for vendors to join the allocation process.
Stall Availability Tracking: The system keeps track of which stalls are available, how big they are, and where they are. This helps the system decide which stalls to give to vendors

* Allocation Algorithms: The system uses smart algorithms to decide which stalls to give to which vendors. It looks at things like what vendors want, stall sizes, and how long vendors have been there.
* Communication Tools: The system helps vendors and administrators talk to each other. Vendors get messages about their stalls, and administrators can help if there are any problems.
* Efficiency and Transparency: The system makes things quicker and clearer by using computers to decide which stalls to give. This way, there are fewer problems, and everyone knows what's happening.
* Reporting and Analytics: The system keeps track of information and makes reports. These reports show things like which stalls are used, what vendors like, and how things are going. This helps administrators make better plans, and vendors know what's happening.
